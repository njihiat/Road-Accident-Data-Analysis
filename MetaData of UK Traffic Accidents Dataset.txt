Inspiration:
1. How has changing traffic flow impacted accidents?
2. Can we predict accident rates over time? What might improve accident rates?
3. Plot interactive maps of changing trends, e.g. How has London has changed for 	cyclists? Busiest roads in the nation?
4. Which areas never change and why? Identify infrastructure needs, failings and 	successes.
5. How have Rural and Urban areas differed (see RoadCategory)? How about the 	differences between England, Scotland, and Wales?
6. The UK government also like to look at miles driven. You can do this by 	multiplying the AADF by the corresponding length of road (link length) and by 	the number of days in the years. What does this tell you about UK roads?
